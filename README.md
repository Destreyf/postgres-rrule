# postgres-rrule

Parse RRULE statements, and generate occurrences.

## Install

Execute `postgres-rrule.sql` in your database:

```
  $ psql -X -f postgres-rrule.sql
```

Or

```
  $ make all
```

And modify your search path to include `_rrule` schema:

```
  SET search_path TO public, _rrule;
```

## Testing

Requires `pgTAP` and `pg_resolve`. First let's install those from CPAN.

```
  $ sudo cpan TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::pgTAP
```

Now you can run the tests with

```
  $ make all test
```


## Contribute

This repo is a fork of Matthew Schinckel's [original repo](https://bitbucket.org/schinckel/postgres-rrule). I have cleaned up some functions and fixed a few tests. There are still a few broken tests that I couldn't fix. If you can lend a help, please create an issue on this repo.

## How it works

We create a table (in a newly created `_rrule` schema) called `RRULE` to generate start dates from rule criteria. The table constraints enforce the validity of dates in the table.

All of the types and functions are created in that schema.

### Operators

| Operator | Description | Notes | Result |
| -------- | ----------- | ----- | ------ |
| `=` | equal | All parameters match | `boolean` |
| `<>` | not equal | Any parameters don't match | `boolean` |
| `@>` | contains `rrule` | All occurrences generated by second rule would also be generated by first rule | `boolean` |
| `<@` | contained by `rrule` | | `boolean` |

### Functions

In the case of the `rrule` functions, there is a second required argument of type `timestamp`, which is the `"dtstart"` argument of a `rruleset`. There is a form for each `rrule`-accepting function that accepts a `text` value, and parses it.




| Function | Return Type | Description | Example | Result |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------|
| after             | `timestamp[]` |||
| all_starts        | `timestamp[]` |||
| before            | `timestamp[]` |||
| build_interval    | `interval` |||
| compare_equal     | `boolean` |||
| compare_not_equal | `boolean` |||
| contained_by      | `boolean` |||
| contains          | `boolean` |||
| day_array         | `day[]` |||
| enum_index_of     | `integer` |||
| explode           | `rrule[]` |||
| explode_interval  | `exploded_interval` |||
| factor            | `integer` |||
| first             | `timestamp` |||
| integer_array     | `integer[]` |||
| interval_contains | `boolean` |||
| is_finite         | `boolean` |||
| last              | `timestamp` |||
| occurrences       | `timestamp[]`  |||
| rrule             | `rrule` |||
| until             | `timestamp` |||
